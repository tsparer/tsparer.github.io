title: Encounters with Messy Public Data
---
This is a blog post about my experience using publicly available datasets to optimize the placement of canvassing teams on the MTA. The process itself was straightforward enough: finding datasets, cleaning them, merging with other data, etc.  I noticed an interestingly conjoined hurdle related to the way groups of collaborating strangers handle unexpected problems- and public datasets certainly present a number of those.

I would like to write more on this, but the deadline is approaching, and it's late, and I need to sleep.
More later, maybe?
